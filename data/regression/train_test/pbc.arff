% DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
% 
% Below is a description of the variables recorded from the Mayo Clinic trial 
% in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 
% 1984.  A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during
% that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo 
% controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data 
% set participated in the randomized trial, and contain largely complete data. 
% The additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical trial, but 
% consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.
% Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so there 
% are data here on an additional 106 cases as well as the 312 randomized 
% participants. Missing data items are denoted by ".".  At least one space 
% separates each variable in the .DAT file.  Censoring was due to liver 
% transplantation for twenty-five subjects with the following case numbers: 
% 5, 105, 111, 120, 125, 158, 183, 241, 246, 247, 254, 263, 264, 265, 274,

% VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
% 
% The data are in free format.  That is, at least one blank space separates
% each variable.  The variables contained in the .DAT are:
% 
% 
% N:   Case number.
% X:   The number of days between registration and the earlier of
%      death, liver transplantation, or study analysis time in July, 1986.
% D:   1 if X is time to death, 0 if time to censoring
% Z1:  Treatment Code, 1 = D-penicillamine, 2 = placebo.
% Z2:  Age in years. For the first 312 cases, age was calculated by
%      dividing the number of days between birth and study registration by 365.
% Z3:  Sex, 0 = male, 1 = female.
% Z4:  Presence of ascites, 0 = no, 1 = yes.
% Z5:  Presence of hepatomegaly, 0 = no, 1 = yes.
% Z6:  Presence of spiders 0 = no, 1 = Yes.
% Z7:  Presence of edema, 0 = no edema and no diuretic therapy for
%      edema; 0.5 = edema present for which no diuretic therapy was given, or 
%      edema resolved with diuretic therapy; 1 = edema despite diuretic therapy
% Z8:  Serum bilirubin, in mg/dl.

% STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
% 
% Between January, 1974 and May, 1984, the Mayo Clinic conducted a
% double-blinded randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver
% (PBC), comparing the drug D-penicillamine (DPCA) with a placebo. There
% were 424 patients who met the eligibility criteria seen at the Clinic while
% the trial was open for patient registration. Both the treating physician and
% the patient agreed to participate in the randomized trial in 312 of the 424
% cases. The date of randomization and a large number of clinical, biochemical,
% serologic, and histologic parameters were recorded for each of the 312
% clinical trial patients. The data from the trial were analyzed in 1986 for
% presentation in the clinical literature. For that analysis, disease and 
% survival status as of July, 1986, were recorded for as many patients as 
% possible.  By that date, 125 of the 312 patients had died, with only 11 
% not attributable to PBC.  Eight patients had been lost to follow up, and 19 
% had undergone liver transplantation. 
% 
% PBC is a rare but fatal chronic liver disease of unknown cause,
% with a prevalence of about 50-cases-per-million population. The primary
% pathologic event appears to be the destruction of interlobular bile ducts,
% which may be mediated by immunologic mechanisms. The data discussed here are
% important in two respects. First, controlled clinical trials are difficult to
% complete in rare diseases, and this case series of patients uniformly
% diagnosed, treated, and followed is the largest existing for PBC. The
% treatment comparison in this trial is more precise than in similar trials
% having fewer participants and avoids the bias that may arise in comparing
% a case series to historical controls. Second, the data present an
% opportunity to study the natural history of the disease. We will see that, 
% despite the immunosuppressive properties of DPCA, there are no detectable
% differences between the distributions of survival times for the DPCA and
% placebo treatment groups. This suggests that these groups can be combined
% in studying the association between survival time from randomization and
% clinical and other measurements. In the early to mid 1980s, the rate of 
% successful liver transplant increased substantially, and transplant has 
% become an effective therapy for PBC. The Mayo Clinic data set is therefore 
% one of the last allowing a study of the natural history of PBC in patients 
% who were treated with only supportive care or its equivalent. The PBC data 
% can be used to: estimate a survival distribution; test for differences 
% between two groups; and estimate covariate effects via a regression
% model.
